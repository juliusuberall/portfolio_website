                <div id="abstract">Text-to-image generative models have become a prominent and powerful tool that excels at generating high-resolution realistic images. However, guiding the generative process of these models to consider detailed forms of conditioning reflecting style and/or structure information remains an open problem. In this paper, we present LoRAdapter, an approach that unifies both style and structure conditioning under the same formulation using a novel conditional LoRA block that enables zero-shot control. LoRAdapter is an efficient, powerful, and architecture- agnostic approach to condition text-to-image diffusion models, which enables fine-grained control conditioning during generation and outperforms recent state- of-the-art approaches.</div>
