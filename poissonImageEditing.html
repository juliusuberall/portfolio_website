                <div id="abstract">During my MSc in Computer Graphics, Vision and Imaging I was lecturing a module about Image Processing in which one of my student projects focused on Poisson Image Editing. It is a seamless cloning method to transfer and interpolate a frequency pattern from an arbitrary image into another solving a poisson equation for each pixel to clone. The method was first introduced by Perez et al. in 2003.</div>

                <div class="section_text">We will mainly focus on guided image interpolation, which in simple terms adjusts the image intensities over region \(\Omega\) such that their gradient matches a reference gradient. This optimization is in a way separated from the color itself and alters the image on a more abstract level by remodelling the "curvature" of its intensities.<br><br> All we need is a destination image \(D\) with region \(\Omega\) in which we want to clone the region \(\Omega\) from a source image \(S\) described by its vector field \(v\), capturing the gradience. In theory one could come up with any \(v\) without requiring \(S\), however we will stick to it for clarity.</div>

Within \(f*\) we have the interpolation region \(\Omega\) which is represented with function \(f\) and solved for under the guidance of vector field \(v\) and given the dirichlet boundary condition \(\delta\Omega\). In this example vector field \(v\) is the image gradient for \(S\) within the corresponding region \(\Omega\).</figcaption>

When importing the gradient this reflection gets blurred, when mixing it is preserved. On the other hand we showcase for reference how \(\Omega\) would look like if it would be just pasted in the destination and not interpolated, creating high, unnatural looking frequencies at \(\delta \Omega\).</div>

                <div class="section_text">It is a widely known issue of using arbitrary images as textures for 3D models that by populating the geometry with the texture tile they create visible tiling seams which are not desired. Poisson image editing can be used to synthesise a seamless texture tile from any texture. With the above technique it is possible to take some arbitrary image and create a ‘tiling’ boundary condition \(\delta \Omega\) by mirroring the edge conditions, such that when solved for one removes the tiling seam.</div>

                <figcaption>Figure 9: Seamless tiling takes any given image and creates a source and destination image for the poisson solver. The source image is padded by offsetting its boundary, the destination image mirrors this padding SN and WE. Importing the gradience from the source image will cause the tile boundary to be interpolated into the tiling grid and ultimately blend the seam.</figcaption>

                <div class="section_text">The effect of seamless tiling becomes particularly visible when applying it to a texture with big differences in illumination, given that textures mostly follow the same pattern when it comes to color and gradience. In such a case the method evenly distributes the illumination across the tile and the seam becomes nearly invisible even though the texture pattern does not match exactly. In figure 11 this illumination redistribution is made visible and indicates basically a complementary intensity to the original tile.
